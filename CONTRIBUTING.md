## üîÑ Development Process

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Stable releases and production code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature branches
- `fix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates

### Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch** from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   make dev  # Full development build with tests
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

## üìù Coding Standards

### Go Style Guide

We follow the standard Go conventions with some additions:

1. **Formatting**: Use `gofmt` and `goimports`
2. **Naming**: Follow Go naming conventions
3. **Comments**: Document all exported functions and types
4. **Error handling**: Always handle errors explicitly
5. **Testing**: Write tests for all new functionality

### Vulkan-Specific Guidelines

1. **Resource Management**: Always implement proper cleanup
2. **Error Handling**: Use our error wrapper types
3. **Memory Safety**: Prefer safe abstractions over raw pointers
4. **Documentation**: Include Vulkan specification references

### Code Example

```go
// CreateBuffer creates a Vulkan buffer with the specified parameters.
// It automatically handles memory allocation and binding.
// 
// See: https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3/html/chap12.html#VkBuffer
func (d *Device) CreateBuffer(createInfo BufferCreateInfo) (*Buffer, error) {
    if err := validateBufferCreateInfo(createInfo); err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid buffer create info: %w", err)
    }
    
    buffer := &Buffer{
        device: d,
        size:   createInfo.Size,
        usage:  createInfo.Usage,
    }
    
    // Implementation...
    
    return buffer, nil
}
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```go
func TestDevice_CreateBuffer(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name        string
        createInfo  BufferCreateInfo
        expectError bool
    }{
        {
            name: "valid buffer",
            createInfo: BufferCreateInfo{
                Size:  1024,
                Usage: BufferUsageVertexBuffer,
            },
            expectError: false,
        },
        {
            name: "zero size buffer",
            createInfo: BufferCreateInfo{
                Size:  0,
                Usage: BufferUsageVertexBuffer,
            },
            expectError: true,
        },
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation...
        })
    }
}
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration tests**: Test interaction between components
- **Example tests**: Ensure examples compile and run
- **Platform tests**: Test platform-specific functionality

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run benchmarks
make bench

# Run specific test
go test -run TestDevice_CreateBuffer ./pkg/vk
```
